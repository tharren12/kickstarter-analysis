# An Analysis of Theater Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

An analysis of theater related Kickstarter campaigns and how they fared in relation to their launch dates and their goals in order to recommend the best course of action for a successful campaign outcome.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The above chart highlights the number of successful, failed and canceled overall theater Kickstarter campaigns by the campaign launch month for the period of 2009 to 2017.
The chart was created by utilizing the Kickstarter database of outcomes and extracting the outcomes for all theatre campaigns over the period and summarizing in a pivot table and then producing the visual chart to summarize the key findings.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The above chart depicts the relative success and failure rate for Kickstarter campaigns for plays within the theatre category, based on the established goal of the Kickstarter campaign for the same time period of 2009 to 2017.
A table was created and based on the plays subcategory whether the outcome was successful, failed or canceled the results were counted and then the percentages were calculated based on this information and the final chart produced.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The data was fairly straight forward to work with, however, if the findings were to focus on a specific region or a subgenre within plays then the information may not be as useful as the results might be too narrow to draw significant conclusions.

## Results

 With regards to the Analysis of Outcomes based on Launch Date the following conclusions can be drawn:
- The greatest number of successful campaigns occured in the May to July timeframe and should be considered when deciding on launch date
- The month of December should be avoided as a campaign launch date as this month had the lowest successful campaigns
- Failed campaigns had fairly consistent results throughout the year regardless of launch date

The following conclusions are based on the Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals:
- The highest success rates were for campaigns with goals of less than $5,000 and in the $35,000 to $45,000 range, with the success rate being 60%+
- The lowest success rates were for campaigns iwht goals of greater than $45,000 and also in the $25,000 to $35,000 range, with the success rate being less than 25%

### Limitations

Some limitations to the findings are the fact that the data can be thin in some observations and therefore additional analysis may have to be undertaken to be more certain in the conclusions.

With respect to the Outcomes based on Launch Date the lowest month for overall launches is December, so the fact this produced the lowest number of successful campaigns should be noted. Additionally May to July have the highest number of campaign launches, which may make it difficult to get attention to your particular campaign, however these months did have the highest success rates and were above the overall average of 61% success.

Regarding Outcomes Based on Goals the data becomes particularly thin with campaign sizes larger than $15,000 and therefore these results should be used as directional only. There is the most number of campaigns with a goal of $1,000 to $4,999 and could feel more confident in a successful campaign at the lower end of the scale.

There could be additional data brought in or more recent information, post-2017, that could help to solidify the findings and more ascertain when the campaign should be launched and what goal should be targeted. May also want to look at Outcomes based on Launch Date specifically for plays as the overall theater category was utilized.
